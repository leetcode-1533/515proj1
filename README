# ass1.m is for Problem 1.1
configurable parameter:
init_point: the initial points before the first curve segment drawn. at least 5( with two segments)
t: curve resolution

slightly different than the note, this program does not need be assigned a final points number. It will assume the last point as final point, and when new point drawn, it will draw 2 curve and erase 1 curve

replace the last curve with new formula(because it is no longer the last curve)
draw the new last curve

see problem1_explanation.png for explanation of the plot.

used 
bezier3.m for ploting curve segment of degree 3


# ass2.m is for Problem 2.1 and Problem 2.2
configurable parameter:
iter: subdividing time, 1,2,3...
num_points: number of points, when n = 4, it is for 2.1
t: interpolation value, usually 0.5

used
bezier_lineappro.m for doing the iteration
bezier_single_line.m for splitting 1 set of control points into 2
